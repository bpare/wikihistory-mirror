Problems I found in the current OPM format:
1. All the tags are "opm:stuff", but they should just be "stuff"
   Similarly, the tag xmlns:opm should just be xmlns
2. "model/v1.1.a" should be "model/opmx#"
3. "causalDependencies" should just be "dependencies"

Fixing these should get you a DOT file, but the DOT file will be broken, because
4. Edit comments containing "quotation marks" will break the DOT format,
   because "quotation marks" have special meaning in DOT.
   So, they need to escaped: all " " in edit comments must be replaced with \" \"
