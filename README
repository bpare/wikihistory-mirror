This software needs the following packages (>sudo apt-get install $PACKAGE)
python-libxml2
python-bitstring
python-pygraph

This is how the software is supposed to work:

First, run >wiki2opm.py 'Title'
	1. It will get every revision of 'Title' from wikipedia.org using wikiiter.py
           This data is saved in cache/Title/REVISION_ID
	2. Then, it will difference the revisions using patch.py
	   The difference is interpreted as a graph where X<-Y if Y changes X.
	3. Finally, it will store and save everything in an opmgraph.py
The final output should be a file 'data/Title-m${NUMBER_OF_REVISIONS}s${START_REVISION_ID}'
This is a simple XML graph format called OPM. It is human-readable.

Then, the tool >query.py 'opm_file.xml' starts a command-line prompt
that lets you run various analyses on the OPM graph, including visualizations.
I'll document these later, but they are essentially just PageRank variants,
and colorizations of the graph based on score (called "heat maps").
